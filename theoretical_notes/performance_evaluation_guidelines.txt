==========================================
Performance Evaluation part.

Pre process dataset (remove insignificant features, map nominal to numeric features, scale features min-max scaling)

Train and test theese models (just on entire test dataset or also splitting it into k folds)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees
- Artificial NN
- Logistic Regression
- Expectation Maximization Clustering
Do summary statistics (in case of k-folds: paired t-test + confidence intervals; otherwise only k-folds).

Do for binary and multiclass classification.

Extra: redo training avoiding the features we find that are most correlated within each other!
