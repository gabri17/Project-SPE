Some notes about the features.

MEANINGFUL FEATURES FOR PREDICTION (some flow and then basic features)
- proto: the network protocol used, it is usefel because there are protocol-specific attack patterns
- state: in which state of the connection we are, suspicious states may indicate port scans or SYN floods
!- dur: DDoS and brute-force can have longer durations

- sbytes: #bytes from source to dest (large can be data exfiltration)
- dbytes: #bytes from dest to source
- sttl: time to live for packets from source to dest
- dttl: time to live for packets from dest to source
!- sloss: source packets retransmitted or dropped (DDos)
!- dloss: destination packets retransmitted or dropped

!- service: Network service used (HTTP, SSH, DNS) (there can be service specific Attacks)

!- Sload: source traffic load (bits per second) (spikes -> DDoS and worm)
- Dload: destination traffic load (bits per second) (data exfiltration or server exploitation)

!- Spkts: #packets from source to dest (many packets -> DDoS)
- Dpkts: #pacekts from dest to source (same)

==========================================================================================================================================

!- swin: source TCP window (recoinnaissance techniques when these values are anomal), buffer size from source to dest
- dwin: buffer size from dest to source

- stcpb and dtcpb are base sequence Numbers
!- smeanz and dmeansz: mean packet sizes (small DDoS, large data exfiltration)

- trans_depth: number of http requests in single connection
- res_bdy_len: actual size of server response

- sjit/djit: network delay variation, source/dest

- stime/ltime: connections start and end times

!- sintpkt and dintpkt: inter-packet times (high values: slow DoS)

- tcprtt/synack/ackdat: TCP connection setup round-trip time and other TCP connection setup times

- is_sm_ips_ports: 1 if source/dest IP+ports identical
- ct_state_ttl: Connection states grouped by TTL ranges
- ct_flw_http_mthd: flows with get/post methods
- is_ftp_login: 1 if FTP used credentials

ct_*: counts of related connections grouped by service/source/destination/port:
- High ct_src_ltm = scanning/host enumeration
- High ct_dst_ltm = targeted victim
- High ct_srv_dst = service-specific attacks
- Abnormal ct_dst_src_ltm = persistent C2 channels

WHAT TO DO:
Ratios like sbytes/dbytes or Spkts/Dpkts can reveal asymmetries (e.g., minimal requests but massive replies → reflection attack).

Features like dur, sloss, and sttl help distinguish attack types:
- Low dur + high Spkts → DDoS.
- High dur + service=SSH → brute-force.

Features like sbytes, dbytes, Sload, and Spkts establish baselines for normal behavior.
